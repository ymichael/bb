# Codebase Guidelines

## Task Completion

- Carry the requested change through implementation, relevant verification, and fixes for failures it causes. Continue authorized, reversible local work without asking for approval at each step; ask when a missing user decision blocks progress.
- Match verification to the change. Once relevant checks pass, broaden or repeat them only for new changes, failures, or unresolved concerns.
- Read the linked guidance when its topic applies to the task.

## Code And Contracts

- Code comments are forbidden, except for semantic tool directives and Plugin SDK declaration comments.
- When renaming a domain concept, search project-wide for stale names in variables, files, query keys, constants, tests, and docs; TypeScript only catches type references.
- Parse and validate data at system boundaries, then pass typed values internally. Restrict `unknown` and `as X` casts to genuinely unknowable boundaries and narrow immediately.
- Keep one-off types local; share types only for real cross-package contracts.
- Optional or nullable fields must represent meaningful absence. Fill defaults once at the server boundary and pass explicit values through internal routes, commands, and persisted events.
- Delete accepted-but-ignored route or command fields, or implement them end to end. Document route and command behavior when it is non-obvious.

## Server And Daemon

- The server owns product policy: defaults, instructions, manager behavior, tool lists, and thread behavior. The host daemon owns host-local primitives, provider translation, runtime/session management, and workspace execution.
- Return raw host-local data from the daemon; assemble product behavior on the server. Move responsibility across this boundary only when the change requires it.
- Increment `HOST_DAEMON_PROTOCOL_VERSION` for changes to server/daemon wire fields, including their types, requiredness, defaults, or meaning, unless compatibility with the previously shipped daemon is deliberately preserved and tested. This covers session payloads, WebSocket messages, and host RPC commands/results. Shared TypeScript builds do not verify compatibility with enrolled machines; the version bump triggers their update.

## CLI And Plugin API

- Every end-user feature must also be usable through the SDK and `bb` CLI; ship and document these surfaces with the UI.
- For changes to CLI commands/flags or user-facing configuration (env vars, `.bb/` workspace files, settings), update the discoverable surfaces listed in [docs/cli-guide-and-skill.md](docs/cli-guide-and-skill.md).
- New public plugin API members (`@get-bb/plugin-sdk/app` exports, `app.slots.*` methods, or `BbPluginApi` properties) require an `experimental_` prefix and an entry in [docs/api_to_audit.md](docs/api_to_audit.md) describing behavior and stabilization criteria. Stabilization includes the audit, a project-wide rename, and removal of the entry.
- The Plugin Guide is the only plugin API documentation. Add new surfaces to `packages/plugin-api-map/src/surfaces.ts` with their SDK symbols.

## Data Access

- Use targeted `WHERE`/`JOIN` queries instead of loading all rows and filtering in JavaScript. Add indexes only when required by the query.
- Change Drizzle schemas and regenerate migrations/snapshots; never edit snapshot JSON manually.
- Never mock the database in tests. Use `createConnection(":memory:")` and `migrate(db)`.

## UI

- Use sanctioned typography tokens instead of arbitrary `text-[Npx]` classes.
- Derive theme colors from `--canvas`/`--ink` or other derived tokens; never use achromatic `oklch(L 0 0)` literals. Mix opaque steps in `oklch` and translucent steps in `oklab`. See `apps/app/src/components/ui/theme.css` and `theme.test.ts`.
- Never use CSS `@scope`; it causes severe WebKit style-recalculation costs. Confine styles with zero-specificity `:where(<roots>)` descendant and compound selector arms, as implemented in `packages/plugin-build/src/scope-plugin-utilities.ts`.
- Use the shared persistent responsive drawer for compact slide-out menus, pickers, popovers, and dialogs. Avoid modal primitives that add `inert` or `aria-hidden` to the app root. Start the transform before heavy content; realize content after two animation frames with a timeout fallback, then retain it. Verify representative drawers in iOS Simulator Safari and test app-root and deferred-realization behavior.

## Build And Test

- Use Turbo for builds, typechecks, and tests so upstream dependencies run first: `pnpm exec turbo run <task> --filter=@bb/<pkg>`. Use the package's actual name for other scopes. Bypass orchestration only for deliberate investigation; do not invoke package scripts or raw `tsc` routinely.
- Generated modules are gitignored: `packages/templates/src/generated/`, `packages/plugin-build/src/generated/`, and `packages/plugin-sdk/bundled-types/`. Never commit them or add a `--check` mode. New generated modules need Turbo tasks with explicit inputs, outputs, and consumer dependencies.
- If a plugin cannot resolve `@get-bb/plugin-sdk`, run `pnpm exec turbo run build:types --filter=@get-bb/plugin-sdk`.
- Test plausible failure modes; avoid trivial getters/setters and framework wiring. Pipe slow test output to a file and inspect it.
- Build Vitest projects with `sharedWorkerProjects` from `vitest.shared.ts`. Node tests share workers (`isolate: false`); DOM tests and files/helpers that mutate worker-global state receive isolated workers. Restore any global state a test changes.

## Issues, Pull Requests, And Debugging

- When filing issues, follow [docs/filing-issues.md](docs/filing-issues.md): reproduce first, check for duplicates, and include versions, copy-pasteable steps, verbatim expected/actual output, commit-permalink evidence, and what you ruled out. Add evidence to an existing issue when applicable.
- Use [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md): root cause, change, verification that demonstrates the fix, and `Fixes #N` when applicable.
- End every agent-created issue and PR body with `> AGENT GENERATED`.
- Ground debugging in observed state: logs, database queries, server APIs, or CLI output. For dev ports, data directories, entity IDs, and the local QA launcher, see [docs/debugging-and-qa.md](docs/debugging-and-qa.md).

`list` and `show` are diagnostic reads: a damaged record remains visible as
`Prompt required` or `Invalid data` instead of failing the whole read. A
`Prompt required` record opens in the Automations panel's standard editor,
where the user can add its prompt while reviewing the other settings. It can
also be repaired directly:

```bash
bb automation update <automationId> --project <id> --prompt "<prompt>"
```

Writes remain strict. Run, pause, and resume reject damaged records; update
succeeds only when the resulting complete record is canonical. Every successful
create/update persists the canonical format.

Choose one of two execution update forms:

- A complete replacement uses `--prompt`, `--provider`, and `--model` together
  to replace the execution with an agent, or `--script`/`--script-file` to
  replace it with a script. Add `--reasoning` and `--service-tier` when needed.
  Include every desired mode-specific setting;
  settings from the previous execution do not carry over.
- A partial agent update preserves every omitted execution field and edits the
  existing agent automation in place. Use any combination of `--prompt`,
  `--provider`, `--model`, `--reasoning`, `--service-tier`, and
  `--permission-mode accept-edits|auto|full`, then choose at most one execution
  target. When changing providers, pass the provider's coherent model,
  reasoning, tier, and permission selection together:

```bash
bb automation update <automationId> --project <id> \
  --environment <environment-id-or-path>
bb automation update <automationId> --project <id> \
  --target-thread <thread-id>
bb automation update <automationId> --project <id> \
  --new-environment worktree [--base-branch <branch>]
```

`--target-thread`, `--environment`, and `--new-environment` are mutually
exclusive. These flags apply only to agent automations; script automations have
no execution environment.

Every command supports `--json`. For `list` and `show`, the JSON result is a
union discriminated by `problem`: canonical records omit it, while degraded
records use `"missing-agent-prompt"` or `"invalid-stored-data"`. The
missing-prompt variant retains the full readable automation; the invalid-data
variant contains only `id`, `projectId`, `name`, and `problem`.

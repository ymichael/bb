# Account Pooler

Use `bb pool` for this plugin's accounts and routes. Inspect current state with
`bb pool status --json` and `bb pool account list --json` before changing routing.
Use `bb pool --help` for available commands.

For account login/import, secret handling, routing settings, ordering, or failover,
read [references/accounts-and-routing.md](references/accounts-and-routing.md).

Use stdin or supported login/import flows for credentials; never put secret values
in command arguments or chat. Confirm the resulting account and routing state.
Do not enable the plugin or change accounts unless the requested task calls for it.
